## Installation

### Preparation

1. Download the STL files from the `cycloidal_drive_parts.zip` file or from [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/933978-cycloidal-drive).
2. Use your preferred slicing software to prepare the files for your 3D printer.

### Print

3. Recommended print settings:
   - Layer height: 0.2mm
   - Infill: 25%
   - Supports: No
4. Print the parts using PLA, PETG, or any other durable filament of your choice.

### Assemble

5. For a step-by-step visual guide, refer to the `cycloidal_drive_assembly_guide.pdf` file in the repository.
6. Test fit all parts to ensure proper alignment before final assembly.
7. Lubricate moving parts with grease to reduce friction and wear.
8. Assemble the cycloidal drive following the guide, securing parts with the appropriate screws and nuts.

### Modify

9. If you want to modify something, download the `cycloidal_drive_fusion.f3d` file and make your modifications in Fusion 360.

## Operation

Once assembled, the cycloidal drive can be used in various applications such as:

- **Robotics:** Precision motion control for robotic arms and joints.
- **Automation:** Actuators in automated systems.
- **Educational Projects:** Demonstrations and experiments in mechanical engineering.

To operate the drive:

- Rotate the input shaft to see the high-torque output motion.
- Observe the smooth, precise movement with minimal backlash.

This model is an excellent tool for demonstrating the principles and benefits of cycloidal drives.
